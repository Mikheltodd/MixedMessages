## General Information
- Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
- Project Objectives:
    * Build a message generator program using JavaScript
    * Use Git version control
    * Use command line
    * Local development
- This is a portfolio project to show basic JS commands and version control skills
- The purpose of this project is to design a program to generate randomized (and coherent) messages about different topics. 
- I started this project following the Codecademy's Full Stack Path and practice my programming skills.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line


## Features
- Message Generator (random) about Music Facts

## Room for Improvement

It could be great if the user could select the topic the messages are about. The program could provide a list of topics and the user chooses the one he/she most like. 

Room for improvement:
- Show the user different topic options
- Depending on the user's input, select a topic on the main object (create a file to import)

To do:
- Create an object containing different topics
- Depending on the topic, define the structure of the message
