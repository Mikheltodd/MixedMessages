# Project Plan

1. Objective: 

> To create a message generator program using JavaScript. This program will print in the console/terminal a different (random) message every time the user runs it.

2. Tasks: 

> [x] Define a topic: what types of messages the program will output. 
>   To randomize the message, it should be made up of multiple strings.
> [x] Create script and run it locally using node (script.js)
> [x] Set up version control
> [x] Store message components. Define structure of the message (at least 3 sets of data) - Object of arrays
> [x] Create the message: add functionality to randomly select the different message components to create a cohesive message (iterate through the object and use switch case to select and format each different message component)
> [x] Put the program together (use a function to handle the overall formatting and display of the message)

3. Beyond the scope (next steps)

> Add random ASCII art
